HR Employee Retention Report
Prepared for Stakeholders
Based on Analysis of Termination and Tenure Trends
Executive Summary
This report summarizes key findings from an analysis of employee retention trends across departments, states, and demographic groups within the organization. Using data from 2000–2020, I identify areas of concern, highlight positive trends, and suggest opportunities for targeted HR initiatives to improve workforce stability.
Key Findings
1. Termination Rate by Department
•	Highest Termination Rates:
o	Auditing
o	Legal
•	Lower Termination Rates:
o	Marketing
o	Business Development
Notably, there is significant turnover in the lead generation departments (Marketing and Business Development). The data does not specify whether the terminations are occurring at the leadership level or among their reports. If leadership is affected, it may be necessary to investigate whether the messaging for brand awareness and customer base targeting remains aligned. Frequent turnover in leadership could lead to new leaders wanting to leave their mark on the company's growth strategy, potentially disrupting the consistency of our brand image presented to customers.
2. Average Employee Tenure
•	Tenure distribution across departments is an average of 8 years.
3. Employee Change Over Time (2000–2020)
•	Overall employee change rate remained between 85%–95% over the two decades.
•	Minor peaks correlate with broader economic events in the 2020 pandemic period.
o	This may suggest that the company was able to weather or gain traction in its industry. Such as more people consuming streaming services or needing home necessities. Alos, the ability to switch over to remote work.
4. Termination Rate by State
•	Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio report the highest state-level termination rates.
o	Wisconsin and Indiana have similar termination rates to Ohio, even though less employees are stationed there. 
•	Regional differences could be influenced by local labor market conditions, cost of living, and industry competition.
5. Termination Rate by Race
•	Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander employees experience the highest termination rates (~13.6%) even with a lower number of employees that identify as such.
•	This highlights the need for deeper analysis into whether cultural, structural, or systemic factors influence employee separations across demographics.
Recommendations
1.	Department-Specific Retention Plans
o	Focus retention efforts on high-risk departments like Auditing, and Legal.
o	Conduct exit interviews and stay interviews to gather actionable feedback.
2.	Regional Strategies
o	Review HR strategies and compensation packages in high-turnover states to remain competitive.
3.	Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives
o	Investigate termination drivers among higher-risk racial groups.
4.	Monitor Trends Post-2020
o	Pay close attention to workforce trends beyond 2020 to capture the lasting impacts of remote work and shifting employee expectations.
Conclusion
While the organization maintains overall stability, specific departments, states, and demographic groups show higher vulnerability to employee turnover. Proactive, HR strategies recommended above can significantly improve retention, reduce hiring costs, and enhance organizational health over the coming years.
